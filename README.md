#### Description
###### This is a pet project to enhance my understanding of HTML5 and CSS. I plan to recreate the Alaskaair.com's index page with pure HTML and CSS without touching bootstrap in any way. As this will not include any programming language such as Javascript, the website will be practically functionless apart from the links being active. This is not a test of logic, rather of design principles. This webpage will be as I visited it on 9/5/2018 as some aspects may have changed.

###### I do not intend to monetize this website in any way or host it anywhere apart from Github pages. It is solely for educational purposes.

Keep in mind that this website is not supposed to be, at this point (9/7/2018), formatted for multiple devices. The default width that the CSS is tailored to is a window that is: 1152px X 758px as this is the default for the device I'm working on.
